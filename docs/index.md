# Ensure that documented examples are tested

Linblocks is a tool for maintaining code documentation.  

It solves the issue of outdated coding examples by:

- Generating unit test for documented examples or generating documentation from unit tests (single source of truth).
- Providing a CLI and a module function to automatically update documentation with the latest code.
- Preserving formatting during code insertion (unlike templating libraries such as jinja).

Lineblocks ensures that documented examples are tested.

# Installation 

```bash
pip install lineblock
